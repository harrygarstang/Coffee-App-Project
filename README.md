# Coffee Curator -The Interactive Front-End Application
## Welcome to our first project!

Hello, hello, coffe lovers and future front-end developers! We're a team of three bright and passionate front-end developers in the making, taking over the world with the coolest API-based Coffe app.

## Project Requirements

We used everything we learned over the past eight modules to create a real-world front-end application that requires collaborative coding and could be shown to potential employers.

Here are the main requirements:
* Use Bootstrap.
* Deploy to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two server-side APIs Links to an external site.
* Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
* Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).

## Who Is Our Audience? 
Coffee lovers
## What is the problem our app will address? 
When visiting a new place, it is hard to easily find out which places serve a good coffee
## How does our app solve that problem?
Offers a simple list of 5 coffee places nearby.

## User Story

```text
AS A travelling coffee lover
I WANT to see the nearest coffee shops
SO THAT I can get my coffee fix in the coolest places anywhere i go
```
## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a dashboard that displays nearby coffee shps based on user input.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with the nearest five coffee shops. 

  * When a user views the coffee shops for their current location, they are presented with:
    * The coffe shop name
    * The address
    * The rating.

## Mock-Up

## Knowledge Applied

* Access properties of objects.
* Master dynamic element generation and AJAX calls.
* Using $.ajax() to make requests and handle responses.
* Understand and utilize the concept and utility of API endpoints and JSON in web applications.
* Access data on RESTful web APIs using AJAX calls.
* Process returned data to isolate key elements that we used with JavaScript logic.
* Generate page elements based on API responses.
* Make successful calls to 2 Google Maps APIs and use the data-rich JSON output to update the dashboard with the name of the coffe shop, address, and customer rating.

## Result

* The URL of the functional, deployed application is [here](https://harrygarstang.github.io/Coffee-App-Project/).

* The URL of the GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/harrygarstang/Coffee-App-Project).

## Future Developments
* Add feature to be able to produce statistics about how often a coffee shop is viewed and/OR visited.
* Add feature to be able to notify coffee shop that customer is on their way.
* Add feature ‘Spotify-wrap up style’ counter of how often you visited your favourite coffee shops. 
* Once you’ve visited a place, there would be a prompt inviting the user to provide a review.
